# Proposed Tech Stack for UniHub

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the technology stack for the UniHub project, with a specific focus on how each component will contribute to the application's performance, scalability, and user experience. The core C++ logic for implementing data structures remains the central feature of this architecture.

## 1. Frontend: User Interface and Experience
The frontend is what the user directly interacts with. Our choices here prioritize a fast, responsive, and easy-to-maintain user interface.
* **Framework**: **React.js**. A component-based JavaScript library perfect for building reusable UI elements like `ResourceCard` and `SearchFilter`. This modular approach simplifies development, debugging, and scaling. React's Virtual DOM ensures a smoother, high-performance user experience.
* **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS**. A utility-first CSS framework that accelerates development by using pre-defined classes. This ensures a consistent design language and is highly effective for building responsive layouts.
* **State Management**: **Zustand or React Context**. Critical for managing shared data (e.g., user login status, search queries) across the application. React Context handles simple global state, while a lightweight library like Zustand is ideal for more complex, scalable state management, preventing "prop drilling."

## 2. Backend: Core Logic and API
The backend is where the project's unique C++ logic resides. It acts as the brain of the application, handling all data processing and serving information to the frontend.
* **Core Logic**: **C++**. The performance-critical components—including search functionality (using an **Inverted Index** and **Trie**), forum threading (with a **Tree** data structure), and complex analytics—will be implemented in C++. This offers low-level control and exceptional speed for operations on large datasets.
* **Web Server**: **Crow or Pistache**. Lightweight, high-performance C++ web server frameworks that act as a bridge between the web and our C++ core logic. They receive HTTP requests from the frontend, route them to the appropriate C++ function, and format the output.
* **Communication**: **RESTful API with JSON**. The standard for frontend-backend communication. The frontend makes HTTP requests (GET, POST) to API endpoints, and all data is exchanged in the lightweight, human-readable JSON format.

## 3. Database and Storage
This layer handles the persistence of all data and files, ensuring that information is saved and available even after the application closes.
* **Primary Database**: **MongoDB**. A NoSQL, document-based database whose flexible schema aligns perfectly with our proposed data structures. It stores all resource metadata, user profiles, and community data in scalable, JSON-like objects. The C++ backend will use the official MongoDB C++ driver.
* **File Storage**: **Google Cloud Storage or Firebase Storage**. Dedicated cloud storage services for storing large files (PDFs, videos). This prevents the database from becoming bloated and slow. The database will only store a URL pointing to the file's location, keeping it fast and lightweight.

## 4. Deployment and Infrastructure
This section covers how the application will be hosted and managed.
* **Cloud Platform**: **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. An integrated platform that simplifies deployment. We will use services like **Compute Engine** for hosting the C++ backend and **Cloud Storage** for file management. **Firebase Authentication** can provide a robust and secure user login system.
* **Caching**: **Redis**. An in-memory data store used to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., popular resources, leaderboards) to significantly reduce database load and improve response times.

## Tech Stack Flow
The entire application operates on a clear flow of data:

**User (Browser) → Frontend (React.js) → Backend (C++ API Server) ↔ Database (MongoDB) / File Storage (GCP Storage)**

A user interacts with the React frontend, which sends requests to the C++ backend. The backend processes the request using its high-performance data structures, interacts with MongoDB to read/write data, and handles file uploads to Google Cloud Storage. The final result is then sent back to the user via the frontend.
