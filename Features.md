# UniHub: A Comprehensive Platform for Student Resources

## 1. Core Functionality

### User Authentication
A secure system for students to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles using either a simple email/password system or social logins.

### Search and Filter
A robust search bar and filtering options that allow users to find resources by:
* **Major/Department:** E.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Fine Arts.
* **Course Code:** E.g., CSC101, PHY203.
* **Resource Type:** E.g., Notes, Past Papers, Textbooks, Video Lectures.

### Major/Department Pages
Dedicated pages for each major, acting as a home base for all resources related to that field. These pages should be well-organized and easy to navigate.

### Resource Upload
A simple and secure way for students to upload their own notes, past papers, and other materials. The platform should include clear guidelines on what can be shared.

### File Previews
Allow users to preview documents (like PDFs) or watch videos directly on the site before downloading.

### Moderation
A system for a team of moderators to review new uploads to ensure they are appropriate and correctly categorized.

### Resource Versioning
For notes and other editable documents, you could allow multiple versions to be uploaded, so students can see how the notes have been updated over time.
