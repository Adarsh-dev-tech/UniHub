- **Profile-based Content**: Resources are filtered based on user's branch, year, and semester
- **Subject Organization**: Clean organization by academic subjects with professor information
- **Multiple Resource Types**: Support for Course Plans, CT Papers, End Sem Papers, PPTs, Class Notes, Reference Books, YouTube Links, and custom categories

### Modern User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes with persistent user preference
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clean dashboard with easy subject access
- **Real-time Feedback**: Toast notifications and loading states for better UX

### Secure Resource Management
- **File Upload System**: Secure file upload with validation and size limits
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with protected routes
- **Download Tracking**: Monitor resource usage and popularity
- **Tag-based Organization**: Searchable tags for better resource discovery
